Bash
====

The Bash shell is the foundation for the Opal framework. 

Files
-----

Bash uses two main configuration files - ~/.bashrc and ~/.bash_profile - to
configure the user experience.

bashrc.bash
^^^^^^^^^^^

The bashrc.bash file is read by ~/.bashrc
   
bash_profile
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The bash_profile.bash file is read by ~/.bash_profile

Core
---- 

The contents of the core.bash are required for Opal.

Functions
---------

The functions.bash file is a collection of general Opal functions. When a set
of functions gets big enough, they get moved to a separate file e.g. prompt
functions.  

Prompts
