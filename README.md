# Opal Documenation

__Official Documentation for the Opal Framework__

A project isn't complete without documenation. This is the official
documentation for the Opal framework.


## Ideas for sections/pages

* Language Translations 
* Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
* Screenshots
* Submit Issues



## Installation

This documentation is published using Read the Docs. The 
Their [tutorial](https://docs.readthedocs.com/platform/stable/tutorial/) 
is useful for getting up to speed

* The contents of the Opal documenation are in `docs/source`
* Locally generate the site: ` sphinx-build -M html docs/source/ docs/build/` 


## Writing Opal Documentation

Read The Docs (RTD) technically supports both Markdown and reStructuredText (reST). For this
project, I've chosen the latter. Not only is reStructuredText more robust, but
it's also more unified. There are several flavors or dialects of Markdown. I
hadn't used reST before. So I decided to use reST for this project. 
**So all Opal Documentation is written in reStructuredText**.
